# event resource type

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

An event in a [user](user.md) calendar, or the default calendar of an Office 365 [group](group.md).

This resource supports:

- Adding your own data to custom properties as [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview).
- Subscribing to [change notifications](/graph/webhooks).
- Using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/event-delta.md) function.

> **Note:** There are a few minor differences in the way you can interact with user calendars, group calendars, and their events:

- You can organize only user calendars in a [calendarGroup](calendargroup.md).
- Outlook automatically accepts all meeting requests on behalf of groups. You can [accept](../api/event-accept.md), [tentatively accept](../api/event-tentativelyaccept.md), or [decline](../api/event-decline.md)  meeting requests for _user_ calendars only.
- Outlook doesn't support reminders for group events. You can [snooze](../api/event-snoozereminder.md) or [dismiss](../api/event-dismissreminder.md) a [reminder](reminder.md) for _user_ calendars only.
