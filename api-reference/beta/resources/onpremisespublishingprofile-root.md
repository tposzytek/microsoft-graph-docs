# On-premises publishing profiles

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Various Azure services (for example, Azue Active Directory Connect Passthrough Authentication, Workday to Azure AD users provisioning) allow a conditional access to various on-premises resources from outside the corporate network. [On-premises agents](onpremisesagent.md) installed by a tenant administrator can be configured to access/handle requests to a particular [published resource](publishedresource.md).
[Agent groups](onpremisesagentgroup.md) enable a tenant admin to assign specific agents to serve specific published on-premises resources. Tenant admins can group a number of agents together, and then assign each published resource to a group. The entire set of entities of the same on-premises publishing type is represented by [onPremisesPublishingProfile](onpremisespublishingprofile.md).

A tenant admin can configure for each **onPremisesPublishingProfile** the [time window](updatewindow.md) during which agents can receive updates or defer updates to the agents. The [updater configuration](hybridagentupdaterconfiguration.md) specified for an **onPremisesPublishingProfile** is applicable to all the agents within that **onPremisesPublishingProfile**.
