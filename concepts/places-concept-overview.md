## Why integrate with places?
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD026 -->

Modern applications today are typically enhanced with location awareness to help provide intelligent context. This helps the user navigate to a place or allows the application to consider a user's location as part of their solution. The [places API](/graph/api/resources/place?view=graph-rest-beta) provides rich detail on locations such as rooms or room lists to enable these scenarios.

### Help customers stay synchronized and navigate their day

Add locations to your calendar and help customers navigate their day and enhance productivity. Enable automated assistants to provide information about rooms in a building. Send more details to your guest on how to get to a room with a map via email. Create your own event catering applications and leverage the [places API](/graph/api/resources/place?view=graph-rest-beta) API to provide room set up.
